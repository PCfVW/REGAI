# REGAI
## Reusing Game Artificial Intelligence
## [AIIDE-2016](http://www.aiide.org) Workshop

**Presentation**

Software engineering deals with the systematic organization of design, implementation and testing of software.
Over the years, various techniques and methodologies have been introduced to increase quality and reliability, while also improving software production.
Notable among these approaches is software reuse, facilitated through modular design approaches and through design patterns.

This workshop will focus on how reuse can be applied to artificial intelligence in the context of digital games, chiefly through:
(i) design patterns which are reusable solutions to recurrent problems and (ii) modularity which allows complex software to be manageable for the purpose of reusing design and implementation in other projects.

This workshop first seeks papers describing design patterns in the context of game artificial intelligence,
but also aims at defining a common documentation and classification of recurrent problems in this area.
Second, this workshop seeks papers describing approaches, techniques and languages in the context of modularity of game artificial intelligence software with the objective of shedding light on this area;
this includes any papers related to testing, modelling, verification and Domain Specific Languages aiming at reusing Game AI.

**Submissions**

For this very first workshop, we seek the following kinds of submissions:  
*   Papers on any facet of reuse and modularity in game AI:
     * Position papers (at most 2 pages); author's views and positions should generate dicussion after an open 5 min presentation during the workshop,
     * Regular papers (6 pages).
*   Game AI Design Patterns (at most 2 pages):  
We ask AI DP writers to submit with the following documentation format (from the [Documentation section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern#Documentation)
of Software Design Patterns, Wikipedia):  

  *  Pattern Name: A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying the pattern.
  *  Intent: A description of the goal behind the pattern.
  *  Also Known As (Aliases): Other names for the pattern.
  *  Motivation (Forces): An sample problem and an example of how this pattern can be used to solve it.
  *  Applicability: Situations in which this pattern is usable; the context for the pattern.
  *  Participants: A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design.
  *  Consequences: A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern.
  *  Known Uses: Examples of real usages of the pattern.
  *  Related Patterns: Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern, as well as a discussion of the differences between this pattern and the similar patterns.

Game AI DPs are intended to be discussed and refined during the workshop. Classification of the patterns will be discussed during the workshop.
Three roles will be played for DP at REGAI:

1. The pattern writer or author will write one or more patterns,

2. The pattern editor will be assigned at least one writer and will try to catch reuse/modularity grammar mistakes in this writer's patterns,

3. The pattern presenter will present patterns at the workshop with the goal of finding extra known uses; if the presenter is also a writer,
then this presenter will not present the pattern(s) he wrote.

We hope to create a fun and friendly atmosphere where unusual presentations and fruitful discussions will make a successful workshop.
